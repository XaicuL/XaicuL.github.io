2026.02: Landing February 2026.

So much has happened, and there have been so many changes. There were days when I opened my calendar to push everything back by a week due to sudden shifts, and other days when a flash of inspiration led me to re-open it and overhaul the entire schedule.

### ✈️ Malaysia Trip and GitHub Contributions
February had long holidays, during which I traveled to Malaysia. During the 4-day trip, I agonized over what to do about my GitHub contributions. Some suggested automation or "backdating" commits, but I didn't want to plant "grass" (contributions) without genuine effort.

My final decision was: **"I'll run harder the week before to get things done ahead of time!"** But I couldn't have imagined the impact that decision would have. Running non-stop is my daily routine, but creating something from 0 to 1 that would cover for me during the trip... the pressure was so immense I thought I'd start losing hair.

### 📚 Reviewing MIT 6.0001 & 6.0002
I always had a personal ambition to perfectly review 6.0001 and 6.0002 once I finished them, and I used this trip as that opportunity. At first, I thought about adding fun elements like **Feynman's** notes, but by the next day, my motto shifted: **"Create the perfect textbook of my own to help those who struggle!"** I ended up gutting and rewriting everything.

> If you look at the 6.0001 repository, there’s a `Notes` folder. I’d love for you to take a look. I worked incredibly hard on it.

### 💾 The Dataset and Google Drive Decision
Even during the trip, the worrying continued. After creating 10 billion mathematical samples, the "1.5TB/2TB" warning on Google Drive became an eyesore. I had two options:

1. **Hugging Face** migration
2. **Google Plan** upgrade

Initially, I chose Hugging Face and began the massive task of moving 10 billion samples. Even on the plane, I looked at screenshots of my code on GoodNotes to refine it further. At the hotel in Malaysia, I ran Colab, but... Hugging Face target-blocked me for an hour repeatedly. It was hot, I was stressed, and a passing dog seemed to be mocking me. In the end, back in Korea, I chose: **"Haha, Google brother! I love you :)"** and thus, my Google Drive became **5TB**.

### 🎙 PyCon Korea Committee Interview
In early February, I interviewed for the PyCon Korea steering committee. 
~~To be clear, the result was a rejection. I look forward to our next meeting.~~

During the 30-minute online interview with people I met for the first time, I learned so much from their gaze and demeanor—listening, accepting, and quoting. The irony is that since that interview, I haven't seen anyone besides my family. If my friends are reading this, I earnestly beg you: please pull me out from behind this monitor for a beer. 🍻

### 🌊 A Month Filled with Passion
My original goal for February was to gain cultural insight by watching great films and works, but I didn't even have time for YouTube, let alone movies. While January was a month of "compressed hardship" with dataset-related explosions, February was a **'Month of Passion'**—constantly editing and challenging myself to achieve systemic perfection. It was a month where passion and courage were more visible than sorrow.

### 🎓 On the Verge of University
Today is February 28th. Tomorrow, I head to university. Although the entrance ceremony is later, I decided to leave on Sunday to visit a professor's office and have a deep conversation.

The goal for March is simple:
**"Protect the routine I've built, no matter what."**
~~My friends called me crazy after seeing my routine on Instagram.~~

6.0002 ends in the first week of March. After that, I’ll take 6.042J and CS50x while studying C++. I felt the speed limits of Python in my bones during the dataset verification process, where outputting a result took 30 seconds. That was the moment I truly realized the necessity of C++.

### 🚀 A New Takeoff
In the end, February, inheriting the efforts of January, takes off like this. I don't know the destination, who the passengers are, or even if I'm the captain, but I’m ready to quicken my steps toward the untrodden path of March.

I thank the crew who boarded this flight with me for the month of February. I am confident that my decisions were the **shortest path** among my available options.

**February, bye!**
