Landing February 2026.

So much has happened, and there have been so many changes. There were days when I opened my calendar to push everything back by a week due to sudden shifts, and other days when a flash of inspiration led me to re-open it and overhaul the entire schedule.

February had long holidays, during which I traveled to Malaysia. During the 4-day trip, I agonized over what to do about my GitHub contributions. Some suggested automation or "post-dating" commits, but I didn't want to plant "grass" (contributions) without genuine effort.

My final decision was: **"I'll run harder the week before to get things done ahead of time!"** But I couldn't have imagined the impact that decision would have.
Running non-stop is my daily routine, but creating something from 0 to 1 that would cover for me during the trip... the pressure was so immense I thought I'd start losing hair.

I always had a personal ambition to perfectly review 6.0001 and 6.0002 once I finished them, and I used this trip as that opportunity. At first, I thought about adding fun elements like **Feynman's** notes, but by the next day, my motto shifted: **"Create the perfect textbook of my own to help those who struggle!"** I ended up gutting and rewriting everything.
~~If you look at the 6.0001 repository, there’s a `Notes` folder. I’d love for you to take a look. I worked incredibly hard on it.~~

Even during the trip, the worrying continued. After creating 10 billion mathematical samples, the "1.5TB/2TB" warning on Google Drive became an eyesore. I had two options:

1. Hugging Face 
2. Google Plan upgrade

Initially, I chose Hugging Face and began the massive task of moving 10 billion samples. Even on the plane, I looked at screenshots of my code on GoodNotes to refine it further. At the hotel in Malaysia, I ran Colab, but... Hugging Face target-blocked me for an hour repeatedly. It was hot, I was stressed, and a passing dog seemed to be mocking me.
In the end, back in Korea, I chose: **"Haha, Google brother! I love you :)"** and thus, my Google Drive became **5TB**.

In early February, I interviewed for the PyCon Korea steering committee. 
~~To be clear, the result was a rejection. I look forward to our next meeting.~~

During the 30-minute online interview with people I met for the first time, I learned so much from their gaze and demeanor—listening, accepting, and quoting. The irony is that since that interview, I haven't seen anyone besides my family. ~~If my friends are reading this, I earnestly beg you: please pull me out from behind this monitor for a beer.~~

My original goal for February was to gain cultural insight by watching great films and works, but I didn't even have time for YouTube, let alone movies.

While January was a month of "compressed hardship" with dataset-related explosions, February was a **'Month of Passion'**—constantly editing and challenging myself to achieve systemic perfection. It was a month where passion and courage were more visible than sorrow.

Today is February 28th. Tomorrow, I head to university.
Although the entrance ceremony is later, I decided to leave on Sunday to visit a professor's office and have a deep conversation.

The goal for March is simple:
**"Protect the routine I've built, no matter what."**
~~My friends called me crazy after seeing my routine on Instagram.~~

February... what did I do? It felt dense.
And I want to brag about one thing here! **6.0002 ends in the first week of March ~~Jealous?~~** After that, I’ll take 6.042J and CS50x while studying C++.

I used to think Python's speed was okay...
But while running verification logic every 5000 chunks of the math dataset, it slowed down near the end, taking 30 seconds to output results. I was terrified my PyCharm was broken or the dataset was flawed, and that's when I truly realized the necessity of C++.

I'll discuss this more in March.
WLOG. In the end, February, inheriting the efforts of January, takes off like this.
I don't know the destination, who the passengers are, or even if I'm the captain, but I’m ready to quicken my steps toward the untrodden path of March.

I thank the crew who boarded this flight with me for the month of February. I am confident that my decisions were the **shortest path** among my available options.

After all, January 2026, which will never come again.
And that's it!

February... bye!
