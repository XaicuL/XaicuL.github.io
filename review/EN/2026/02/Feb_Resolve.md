Carrying Over January's Efforts into February :)

February has arrived.
My goal for February is simple.
A to Z: Comprehensive. Investigative. Audit.

I need to check everything.
I need to look back at the path I’ve walked.
I need to audit even my daily routines.
~~I even need to check my face in the mirror.~~

First, I must perform a definitive check on my **ongoing HND research**...
I should re-examine the dataset generation, just in case.
I need to check again if there were any accidental conversions to `int64` or `float64` during the training process.

Since I’ll be entering university in March,
yesterday I was rushing my steps, thinking, "I hope March comes quickly!" because it's a path I’ve never taken.
But today, I’m spending my day thinking, "It's a path I’ve never taken, so I'm scared! I hope March comes late!!"

Routine as a freshman, course registration, building rapport with my peers, etc.
There are so many variables with complex fluidity that I think I should have Plans A, B, and C all ready...

The best-case scenario would be to become someone who is just quiet but knows how to have fun when the time comes—sort of like a human binary search.
But everything can change depending on who I meet, what conversations we have, and what mindset I live with.
I thought this was also something to consider.

And... what I need to finish in February:
Math... General Math 1 is finished, and two weeks are enough for General Math 2.
The problem is that after those two weeks, only two weeks will remain until the semester starts...

Since I studied Math 1, Math 2, Geometry, Calculus, and Probability & Statistics while preparing for the Suneung (CSAT),
I think I can finish them quickly. ~~(Of course, I also did General Math 1 & 2 for the Suneung, but I didn't look at them that deeply...)~~

Once I wrap up high school mathematics based on the Korean curriculum,
I’ll probably move on to Linear Algebra. But **before that**, I must implement General Math 1 & 2, Math 1, Math 2, etc., in Python.

There is no department at my university that looks deeply into mathematics...
So, when I apply to the graduate schools I want, the lack of mathematical depth in my completed courses could be a weakness.
Two alternatives have been derived:

a. Take math courses at another university via credit exchange in my sophomore year!!
b. Implement math concepts as projects on GitHub.

My choice was both a and b. I considered 'b' (math implementation) to be a basic requirement,
and I realized I must also do 'a' to gain more expertise.

No matter how many OCW courses (like 6.006, 6.046) I take,
since I don't have documents to prove it, I should keep the credit exchange system and consistent GitHub uploads in mind as I start university life.

And the biggest challenge... **English**...
It is practically the greatest hurdle. Finishing *Grammar in Use* doesn't mean I can suddenly speak fluently.
Doing English only through Duolingo doesn't make conversation easier.
And lying down watching English dramas doesn't make conversation any "cuter."
In the end, I must meet English conversation **consistently**, **every single day**, as if it were my **native language**. ~~Honestly, I find myself not reaching for Duolingo for some reason.~~

I don't have to worry too much about listening or reading,
but it's certain that my speaking and writing are at a level where I should worry significantly.

In February, I should finish *Grammar in Use Basic* once.
In March, while adjusting to shifting variables, I plan to go through *Grammar in Use Basic* maybe 10 times in a month.
I think I must finish it within February...

I think it's right to move to the next stage only after the variables are somewhat "changing-bound" (fixed).
After all, basics aren't "basics" because they are easy or trivial; rather, everything advanced stems from them.
I chose this strategy because I felt polishing the foundations would have the greatest effect... ~~Actually, I'm scared.~~

6.0002 ends in February, and CS50 starts.
Before taking CS50, I must, truly **MUST**, organize 6.0001, 6.0002, and math in Obsidian.

Originally, I didn't have a habit of taking notes.
I used to just scribble things randomly in a Prism note or write things down without any organization.
My philosophy used to be...

> Why bother organizing it when it's already in my brain?

I was that kind of person. But I was inspired by Richard Feynman's note-taking philosophy,
and when the algorithm recommended Obsidian to me on YouTube, I wanted to organize everything in Obsidian.

I think I'll get my acts together and spend time organizing every week starting from CS50.
For 6.0001 and 6.0002, I plan to organize them with a mindset of reviewing while ~~resenting~~ admiring the past me.

My biggest worry lately is that the time spent sleeping feels like such a waste.
I feel like I want Mephisto from *Faust* to come to me too.

There's so much I want to learn.
If time allowed, I’d want to learn Economics and Business Management.
If time allowed, I’d want to learn Physics and Neuroscience more deeply and perfectly.
If time allowed, I’d want to learn Electrical and Electronic Engineering.

There is so, so much I want to learn, but time doesn't permit.

I learned that it's important to set light targets.
So, for my February resolve, I should set just one goal.

**March 2nd: To have no regrets when looking back at the entire month of February.**

I hope I can fully carry over February's efforts into March.
And that's the end of my February resolve!
