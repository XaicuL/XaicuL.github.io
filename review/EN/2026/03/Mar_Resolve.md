2026.03: Merging March into Orbit.

It feels like just the Sunday before last that I welcomed the start of 2026, yet the hour hand has already passed two months and points to March. February was truly a month of constant variables and challenges saying, **"Hi, I'm Variable!"**, **"Hi, I'm Challenge!"**. It felt like trying with all my might to pull up a plane that was losing altitude and on the verge of crashing.

### 🎯 The Single Goal for March
The goal for this month is truly just one:
**"Safeguard the routine I've envisioned at all costs."**
If I can achieve just this, I can look back at this March—even in a minute before closing my eyes for the last time—and say I am truly satisfied.

### 🛡️ Armed with Plan C
Entering university and putting things into action means plans will inevitably need adjustment. That's why I have down to Plan C and even scheduled specific days for these adjustments. Since I planned assuming the worst-case scenario (classes from 9 AM to 6 PM every day), any actual situation more lenient than that will be a pleasant surprise.

### 🧱 First Principle: Overwhelming Foundations
March is the **'Month of Mastering First Principles.'** I’ve decided to look at English, Science, and Math from the very basics.
- **English**: *Grammar in Use* (Orange book) - I went back to learning am, are, is. Haha.
- **Science**: High-top Integrated Science
- **Math**: 10th-grade high school textbooks

The embarrassment I felt in January or February is gone. To become the **undisputed Number 1**, I realized I need two differentiators: **'Solidity from overwhelming foundations'** and **'Expansion speed at the frontier.'** I'm no genius, so I must win with effort rather than talent. I’ve decided to make it a part of my daily life.

### 🏫 The Trembling of Enrollment
Dormitory entry and course registration... I'm so nervous. It's not a trembling of fear, but of not knowing where the line of my control ends. I might have to give up parts of my plan, but I might also get some back like cashback.

### 📈 March Checklist
- [ ] Finalize 6.0001 & 6.0002 Notes
- [ ] Finish 6.0002 & Start CS50, 6.042J
- [ ] Progress through Integrated Science & General Math
- [ ] Study C++
- [ ] Review 2 papers per week

It looks grand, but it's just about doing it. If I split and connect things at the nanometer level, it becomes self-evidently simple.

### Breaking the 66-Day Wall
The biggest hurdle will be the **routine**. I need to break through the 66-day wall where habits are formed. I spend my time these days self-flagellating, asking why I didn't start living by this routine back in January. Success in March will depend on responding flexibly and experiencing failure.

> "I truly pray for meaningful failure."

I need to fail early in March to make near-perfect adjustments by April. While warm spring days will come, I remind myself that this is also the most dangerous and critical start line.

### 🌈 No Burnout
I'm grateful for the environment where I can just pursue what I want to do. If I receive encouragement, I might even dance. ~~I might actually register for a dance academy.~~

I hope to safeguard my routine, learn from many failures, and above all, **not lose myself**.

**March, hi!**
