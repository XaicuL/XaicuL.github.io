Merging March into Orbit

It feels like just the Sunday before last that I welcomed the start of 2026, yet the hour hand has already passed two months and points to March.

February was truly a month of constant variables and challenges saying, **"Hi, I'm Variable!"**, **"Hi, I'm Challenge!"**. It felt like trying with all my might to pull up a plane that was losing altitude and on the verge of crashing.

The goal for this month is truly just one:
**"Safeguard the routine I've envisioned at all costs."**
If I can achieve just this, I can look back at this March—even in a minute before closing my eyes for the last time—and say I am truly satisfied.

But the scary point? The thing I fear is that once I enter university and put things into action, this thing called a "plan" inevitably needs adjustment because its philosophy differs from mine.
~~That's why I have down to Plan C and even scheduled specific days for these adjustments.~~

Everything can't go my way, and since I know it'll likely be very different from what I think, I planned my routine and schedule assuming the worst-case scenario as a priority.

If a passing cat asks what the "worst-case scenario" is, I'll write it here...
I planned assuming classes are every Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri from 9 AM to 6 PM.

It can't be helped. I've never lived or felt how university classes work, so I can't even predict them. I'd rather be pleasantly surprised if things are more relaxed than my worst-case, rather than being stressed if things are worse than my expectations.

March is probably best seen as the **'Month of Mastering First Principles.'**
I’ve decided to look at English, Science, and Math from the very basics.
English with the orange book... ~~learned am, are, is. haha~~
Science with High-top... and Math with 10th-grade high school textbooks...

The feeling of **embarrassment** I felt in January or February is now gone.
Rather, to become the **undisputed Number 1** I desire, I realized I need **differentiation**, which I think comes in two forms: **'Solidity from overwhelming foundations'** & **'Expansion speed at the frontier.'**
I'm no genius. I'm not a fool either. I'm just someone living day by day at the maximum level I can from my position.

As I said before, I'm no genius, so I must win with effort rather than talent.
I've decided not to think about how much or how crazily I should do it.
I've just decided to make it a part of my daily life and do it every day.

Back to a different topic,
Enrollment... and course registration... and dormitory...
I'm so nervous. Truly nervous. But the reason is not fear, but knowing that the line of what I can control is uncertain.

I'll probably have to give up some of the plans I've made, and I might get some back like cashback.
Even so, I'm trembling. Not my legs, but mentally.

What I must achieve in terms of results in March is:
Finalizing 6.0001 & 6.0002 Notes, finishing 6.0002, and starting CS50 & 6.042J.
Progressing through High-top Integrated Science and Math 1, studying C++, and reviewing 2 papers per week.

It looks grand, but it's not. It's just doing it.
It looks difficult, but it's not. I'll learn it and it'll become easy, and if I split and connect things at the nanometer level, it's obvious it won't be difficult.

However, the **routine** will likely be the biggest hurdle.
It means I have to break through the 66-day wall... and since that's not easy, I'm busy self-flagellating, asking why I didn't live by this routine back in January.

It's certain that this is a month for focus and concentration.
I anticipate March will be about responding flexibly and experiencing failure.
I truly pray for meaningful failure.

I need to fail early in March to make near-perfect adjustments by April.
To make these adjustments perfectly in a short time, finding things to learn from many failures is the fastest and most accurate way.

March. Warm spring days will come, and it'll be the most passionate, yet most dangerous month.
I mindful of the fact that how I start will change my future.

I'm not worried about burnout. Since I’ve already spent 3 years pressured even in what I wanted to do, I'm grateful just to have an environment where I can pursue my goals.
If someone even encourages me, I might even dance from joy. ~~Registering for a dance academy.~~

I hope to safeguard my routine, learn from many failures, and above all, **not lose myself**.

I'll end March's Resolve here.

March... hi!
