Welcoming 2026

The year 2025, which felt so incredibly long and tenacious, has finally faded, and 2026—a year that felt so far away it seemed it would never arrive—has finally dawned.
While January 1st of last year remains a bitter memory, I spent the first day of this year in a calm sleep, reflecting on that pain.

On January 2nd, while having coffee, I scrolled through my calendar. A "Future Calendar" packed tightly all the way to 2030.
Even within that, 2026 looks like it will pass by at a breathless pace. I feel a mix of fear and excitement, walking a path I’ve never trodden before… a certain... feeling,,
Nevertheless, one thing remains unchanged: my calendar is already saturated. In fact, it might have already exploded.
With so much I want to do but only one body, I feel once again that this is the moment to coldly determine my priorities.

The upheaval seems set to begin in January. I will finish the MIT 6.0001 course and start 6.0002.
As for the HND research... I just hope at least a draft is completed.
Truthfully, as someone who hasn't even entered undergraduate studies yet, I constantly question whether it's okay for me to be doing "research."
I don't know. I just hope, sincerely, that this January concludes smoothly and well :)
Ah, one last thing: I'd like to overcome my phobia of English before I enroll.
